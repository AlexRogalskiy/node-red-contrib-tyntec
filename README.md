### Step 1: Create a new Node-RED flow

Create a new flow to add your new nodes into it.

### Step 2: Add and edit the "inject" node

Add an "inject" node.

![step 2-1](./docs/step-2-1.png)

Open the edit window of the "inject" node.

![step 2-2](./docs/step-2-2.png)

Set:

- `name` to `Fake temperature sensor`
- `msg.payload.room` to value `Livingroom`
- `msg.payload.temperature` to value `21`

Click to "Done" to save your changes.

### Step 3: Add and edit the "send-sms" node

Add a node called "send-sms" to your flow (you can find the node in a "function" section).

Connect your "Fake temperature sensor" node output to "send-sms" node input.

![step 3-1](./docs/step-3-1.png)

Edit your "send-sms" node.

Set:

- `name` to `Temperature SMS`
- add a new `Tyntec Configuration` with your tyntec API key
- (optional) `From` to your own name, which will appear as the sender's name
- add a new `To` configuration with your own name and phone number (Phone number has to be in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) e.g. `+420123456789`)
- `Message` to 
  ```
  Hello from Node-RED.

  Your temperature in {{msg.payload.room}} is {{msg.payload.temperature}}ÂºC.

  Your lovely tyntec integration.
  ```
- (not recommended) uncheck the `Delivery check` (whether you need to confirm successful or unsuccessful SMS delivery)

### Step 4: Deploy and test your new flow

To deploy a flow, click the red "Deploy" button in the upper right corner.

![step 4-1](./docs/step-4-1.png)

Click on the square on the left side "Fake temperature sensor" to trigger the flow.

You should now see a blue dot labeled "accepted" when the SMS delivery has been triggered via the API.

If the SMS has not been delivered, the blue dot will change to red.
